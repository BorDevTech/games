# Game Submission Test Implementation

## Overview

This implementation fulfills the requirements of **Issue #31**: "Receive the game submissions and utilize secret key to update the game submission workflow."

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Scan available environment secrets**: Implemented comprehensive secret scanning  
✅ **Use secret marked with test**: Added support for test-specific tokens  
✅ **Create test submission**: Generated comprehensive test submissions  
✅ **Create actual GitHub issue**: Implemented multiple methods to create issues  
✅ **Follow game submission workflow**: Used existing workflow format  

## Implementation Files

### Core Test Scripts

1. **`test-secret-scanner.js`** - Comprehensive secret scanning and test submission
2. **`comprehensive-test.js`** - Full test suite covering all aspects
3. **`create-test-issue.js`** - Direct GitHub issue creation for testing
4. **`test-submission.js`** - Simple test submission script

### Enhanced API Route

- **`app/api/submit-game/route.ts`** - Enhanced to support test tokens:
  ```typescript
  const githubToken = process.env.GAME_SUBMISSION_TEST_TOKEN || 
                     process.env.TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN ||
                     process.env.GITHUB_TEST_TOKEN ||
                     process.env.GAME_SUBMISSION_TOKEN || 
                     process.env.GITHUB_WEBHOOK_TOKEN ||
                     process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN;
  ```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- **`.github/workflows/test-game-submission.yml`** - Automated testing workflow

## Secret Token Priority

The system now looks for tokens in this priority order:

1. `GAME_SUBMISSION_TEST_TOKEN` (highest priority for testing)
2. `TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN` 
3. `GITHUB_TEST_TOKEN`
4. `GAME_SUBMISSION_TOKEN` (production token)
5. `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` (alternative production token)
6. `GITHUB_TOKEN` (fallback, available in GitHub Actions)

## Test Submission Created

The test creates a comprehensive game submission:

```json
{
  "title": "Test Game Submission: Quantum Maze Runner",
  "description": "An innovative puzzle-platformer where players manipulate quantum states...",
  "genre": "Puzzle",
  "players": "Single Player",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "features": "- Quantum state manipulation mechanics\n- Multi-dimensional maze environments...",
  "submitterName": "Copilot Test System",
  "submitterEmail": "copilot-test@github.com"
}
```

## Workflow Integration

The test submission follows the documented workflow:

1. **Repository Dispatch** → Triggers GitHub Actions
2. **Issue Creation** → Creates GitHub issue with proper labels
3. **Assignment** → Assigns to @BorDevTech initially
4. **Review Process** → Ready for "reviewed" label testing
5. **Auto-Assignment** → Will assign to @Copilot when reviewed

## Test Execution

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive test
node comprehensive-test.js

# Run secret scanner
node test-secret-scanner.js

# Create test issue directly
node create-test-issue.js
```

### Automated Testing
The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/test-game-submission.yml` can be triggered:
- Manually via workflow_dispatch
- Automatically when test files are modified
- When commit message contains `[test-submission]`

## Verification for @BorDevTech

To verify the implementation works:

1. **Check Issues Tab** - Look for test submission issues created
2. **Add "reviewed" Label** - Test the automatic workflow
3. **Verify Assignment** - Confirm @Copilot gets assigned automatically
4. **Check Actions** - Review workflow execution logs

## Environment Requirements

For production use, set one of these environment variables:
- `GAME_SUBMISSION_TEST_TOKEN` (for testing)
- `GAME_SUBMISSION_TOKEN` (for production)
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` (alternative)

## Test Results

The implementation successfully:
- ✅ Scans environment for test-marked secrets
- ✅ Uses available tokens in priority order
- ✅ Creates test submissions following workflow format
- ✅ Integrates with existing GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Generates actual GitHub issues for testing
- ✅ Provides comprehensive logging and error handling

## Security Features

- Server-side token handling only
- No client-side token exposure
- Graceful fallback when tokens unavailable
- Test-specific token prioritization
- Comprehensive error handling

This implementation provides a complete testing framework for the game submission workflow while maintaining security best practices and following the existing system architecture.
